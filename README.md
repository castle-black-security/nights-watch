# Night's Watch

## Instructions

This is a skeleton of a simple application for tracking members of the Night's Watch. While the application does compile and run, you are tasked with implementing these key pieces of missing functionality:

- [ ] Update the current static display of members to support dynamic changes without a full page reload.
- [ ] Enhance the members API to support POST and DELETE methods.
- [ ] Implement adding and removing members using the updated API.

This exercise should take no more than a couple hours. If you breeze through the exercise, and have time left over, consider one or the other of these _optional_ infrastructure tasks:

- [ ] Deploy the project to Heroku, including a link to the deployed app with your submission.
- [ ] Dockerize the project and include new package script(s) to build and run the container.

## Getting Started

1. [Install nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#install--update-script)
2. Use nvm to install specific node version and packages:

```bash
nvm install
npm install
```

3. Use the following package scripts to run and build the application:

```bash
# Run dev server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Run production server
npm run start
```

## Submitting

Once you've completed the required tasks, commit your code and submit a PR to the main branch.
